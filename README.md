# Data-Engineering-Data-Warehouse-Project-01-AWS
### **Project Overview**
This project aims to build a centralized data warehouse on Amazon Redshift, integrating data from CRM (Customer Relationship Management) and ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) systems. The solution ensures cost-effective storage by keeping frequently accessed (warm) data in **Amazon Redshift** and less frequently accessed (cold) data in **Amazon S3**, leveraging Redshift Spectrum for seamless querying.
